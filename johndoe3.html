The Borough Code Enforcement Officer was the last of three involved that harassed a resident of the borough of Tenafly NJ over the period of 8 to 9 years. Borough code enforcement #1 or John Doe #1 did visit the property several times over several years. John Doe #1 did speak to the resident of the home/property several times. John Doe then left employ of the Borough of Tenafly NJ<br>
<br>
John Doe #2 did then come onto the property several times late 2017 and interrogate the resident of the home/property. John Doe #2 did order a permit for a repair to the home that was non-existent at the time. Resident did then initiate a repair several days later ASAP as a result of a fine threat of several thousand dollars a day by the Borough Of Tenafly NJ. The repair took several days and cost several thousand dollars. The repair was faulty and has caused damage to the home/property. Several weeks later borough code enforcement #1 (John Doe #2) did barge unto the property again and interrogate and question the resident in almost rapid fire succession. When resident paused to answer the last question. John Doe #2 did mention a summons would be issued.<br>
<br>
The summons arrived in the mail and was addressed to an elder resident of the property. The resident (non-elder) did appear at Borough Of Tenafly NJ municipal court during Nov. 2017. The judge at the time did speak of a condition known as 'Power Of Attorney'. Resident acquired the legal document and appeared again in Dec. 2017. Judge said the elder had to be at court. The current Borough Of Tenafly NJ municipal prosecutor then ordered a trial. The trial was during Jan 2018. The court went through the docket list of cases and requested pleas prior to all cases being heard/judged/etc. Some were not trials. Resident entered a plea of 'not-guilty' on behalf of the elder. The elder has Alzheimers and not sure if had any idea what was going on.<br>
<br>
Upon case against the elder. Judge mentioned the elder could sit down. The judge requested the resident to come forward. The resident is the child of the elder of age in the late 50's. The elder is the parent of the child and was of age in the late 80's. The resident was at the time the caregiver & guardian of the elder. Resident/child was allowed to question the complainant/summonser (John Doe #2). Resident did the re-phrase the question and ask a question a second time. Borough Of Tenafly NJ municipal prosecutor did object to the question. Resident did proceed to sit down and let the court do what they wanted. Tenafly NJ municipal court judged the elder guilty for a pile of twigs/small branches and a piece of wood all in the backyard regarding a property maintenance ordinance violation as part of what is known as the 'International Property Maintenance Code' or IPMC. The IPMC code document is 61 pages in pdf format. It apparently gives the code enforcement officer the right to do anything they want. They can trespass on a residence lot. Knock or bang on a door. Post violations on your home. Repeatedly ring a doorbell. They can file a summons/lawsuit against you if they think there might be a violation. Even if there is no violation. And due to monetary reasons they can get away with it the violation is not valid. A lot of people will just plead guilty and pay the fine. A lot of people don't want to get involved with hiring a lawyer.<br>
<br>
Here we post an example of the IPMC ordinance by the Borough Of Tenafly ratified.<br>
<br>
302.4 Weeds. Premises and exterior property shall be maintained
free from weeds or plant growth in excess of [JURISDICTION
TO INSERT HEIGHT IN INCHES]. Noxious weeds shall
be prohibited. Weeds shall be defined as all grasses, annual
plants and vegetation, other than trees or shrubs provided;
however, this term shall not include cultivated flowers and
gardens.<br>
<br>
Resident response: Have you ever heard of an ornamental grass plant. I see them all over Tenafly NJ and beyond.<br>
<br>
<br>
The elder was fined several hundred dollars. Elder & resident were then stopped in the lobby by a police officer and told to pay the fine.<br>
<br> 
Borough code enforcement officer #2 or John Doe #2 did continue for a while as an employee of the Borough Of Tenafly for a period after. We don't know the reason or circumstances of why John Doe #2 became a non-employee of the Borough Of Tenafly. Resident did an internet search late 2024 or early 2025 regarding John Doe #2. Resident read that John Doe #2 had been fired from another municipality as employee. John Doe #2 did then file a lawsuit against municipality. John Doe #2 then became an employee of another municipality.<br>
<br>
Resident & elder then became involved in numerous litigation proceedings against the Borough Of Tenafly NJ as pro se litigants. The initial municipal appeal was dismissed after numerous documents submitted to Bergen County Superior Court. We showed up at court for our date and the judge was on vacation. The date was actually for a document submission. All further correspondence was ignored. An Appellate case was filed and that was dismissed. A complaint against the Borough Of Tenafly was filed in Bergen County Superior Court and that was dismissed.<br>
<br>
We paid a lawyer to do some work for us. Resident spoke to the lawyer over the phone for a minute or two and the lawyer never filed a procedure on our behalf. Later we sent a deposit to an attorney for a procedure within a several weeks. An associate called several months later. Resident mentioned that the date had passed. We never received our deposit of $2500.00 back.<br>
<br>
Resident hopes that the public can get an idea of what goes in in the legal industry.<br>
<br>
Then borough code enforcement officer #3 or John Doe #3 came onto the property and would stand there and stare at the rear yard. Postings on the front door began to appear. Summons/lawsuits began to appear in the mailbox. Municipal court proceedings began to appear in the mailbox. John Doe #3 did come to the front door a year or so later and pound on the door so hard that the door was damaged and cracked at the seams. John Doe #3 then enlisted the help of another Borough of Tenafly associate. We refer to the associate as John Doe #4. John Doe #4 & John Doe #3 and the borough council along with possibly the mayor. Did organize a pseudo raid on the lot/property. They showed up with several police vehicles and officers. Along with a carting truck and several containers. John Doe #3 was not at the door when the police officer pounded on the front door causing more damage to the front door. John Doe #4 was at the front door. Resident mentioned that at the last door pounding, resident had crapped in one's pants. Contractor and employees began to remove items from the rear yard at the direction of John Doe #4. John Doe #3 was there smiling and laughing. Contractor used a Bobcat tractor to remove personal effects from the rear yard. The tractor doesn't have steering wheels that turn so the tractor can drive around like a traditional tractor or sit down lawn mower. Instead it uses I believe a joystick that makes certain wheels rotate causing the tractor to twist and turn. Said tractor did cause a mud like condition all over the yard. The yard was covered in some snow and was somewhat wet. The rear yard was totally destroyed in certain areas. Some sort of tumbleweed did take hold afterwards and inundate the yard with weeds ever since. The plant or weed only grows seeds on its branches. No leaves or foliage.<br>
<br>
Taken from the yard were some valuable possessions like a Danish Modern chair worth $1000 - $2000. Garage door panels to repair the garage door. Instead the garage door ios now broken and we haven't been able to open the door or repair.<br>
<br>
John Doe #4 stayed only for a short while in the rear yard and then left the three contractor laborers to do whatever they wanted. Resident observed them in the backyard laughing & playing around. After they came back from lunch they said to the resident we don't want to be doing this. We don't know what's garbage and what isn't.<br>
<br>
Contractor operated the carting truck & containers used 3 half height containers instead of a regular maximum height container that a normal carting company would use. Said company was not in the business of refuse/garbage removal but rather landscaping and other work and had in their ownership said containers. Also the containers were not filled to capacity. So resident estimates that one full height or one half height would have sufficed. This would have reduced the lien amount upon the elder's lot/property by a large dollar amount.<br>
<br>
After the pseudo raid on the property John Doe #3 did appear the following week or so parked outside for a long time staring into the home. And did continue to do so. Resident photographed John Doe #3 as well as on prior occassions.<br>
<br>
John Doe #3 did then continue to stalk the lot/property. File numerous summons/complaints. Conduct numerous drive by inspections. Come to the front door and knock. Speak to the resident inside the house saying and pointing, "I want to speak to you". Resident recorded the visit.<br>
<br>
The purpose of this website is for you the people to cause change within the Borough Of Tenafly NJ, the State Of New Jersey & the USA I hope.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see a lot of things within the borough of Tenafly that can be changed for the betterment of the citizens|residents of Tenafly NJ.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why a petition? You may want something changed. Or. You have been wronged! By the Borough. Have you? You may contact us confidentially!<br>
